#Blackjack


1. Select "New game"
2. A form will appear to complete with your data. Indicate the amount of money with which you enter the game and the amount you wish to bet.
3. Once you click "Start," the cards are automatically dealt, two for you and two for the Dealer. You can choose whether to draw a card or keep, by clicking on the "Hit" (to draw a card) or "Stay" (to keep your cards) buttons.
4. You can draw up to 3 cards to have 5 in your hand. After this it is Dealer's turn to make his play. If you decide to keep your cards before having 5 cards, press the "Stay" button.
5. After pressing the "Stay" button or that you have 5 cards in your hand, it is the Dealer's turn, which has the same rules. After the Dealer finishes his play, the point sums of both the player and the Dealer are compared.
6. If you or the Dealer exceed 21 points during your turn, they automatically lose and must pay the bet.
Considerations:
If at the beginning of the game the dealer has a card with a value of 10 or 11, the player has the possibility of "Assuring", indicating that the dealer has 21 points in his first two cards. If you decide to insure and the Dealer has 21 points, and you insured, you lose half of your bet. Otherwise, if he assured and both the player and the Dealer have 21 points, the player wins his bet plus half of it.
You cannot bet more money than you have.
In each new game you have to enter a new bet.
Win who has 21 points or get as close as possible without going over.
Good luck
